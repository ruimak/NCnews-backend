do i have to chain populates? ex retrieve comments in article controler

how do i populate a field which is referenced by a topics "topic slug"

dont understand this lie -> Also collection.remove is deprecated. Use deleteOne instead

why and how to add "Comment count is missing from articles"


"When testing a 200 endpoint make sure that every key the repsonse is supposed to have exists. You are checking title and body but none of the other required fields. ( Including commment count for articles)" -> expect(something).to.have.all.keys('key1', 'key2')
also, should i test for the content of those keys? what if i dont know the exact content eg. mongoID

in the postCommentForArticleId why cant i change every belongs_to to req.params.article_id

is the invalid route in the app file needed ?
